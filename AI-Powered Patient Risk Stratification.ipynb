    "##### Your project aims to develop an AI-powered patient risk stratification tool that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifies high-risk patients who need immediate bed allocation.\n",
    "- Manages low to medium-risk patients through medication and monitors their adherence.\n",
    "- Continuously updates patient risk levels based on daily updates.\n",
    "- Allocates hospital resources and manages staff based on patient risk levels.\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### To effectively develop this tool, you need a dataset that provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patient demographics and medical history.\n",
    "- Clinical features relevant to risk assessment (e.g., vital signs, lab results).\n",
    "- Information on hospital admissions and resource utilization.\n",
    "- Data on medication adherence or the ability to simulate it.\n",
    "- Outcome variables to validate risk predictions.\n"
